        <p className="about-p">
          Pick a section, tick the topics you want, and the list shows every
          matching question with how you did on it last time. Hide the ones you
          have already done, or filter down to just the ones you got wrong.

        <p className="about-p">
          LightBluePrep does not host the questions. Your browser downloads them
          straight from College Board and keeps a copy, so the first visit takes
          a few seconds and after that it is fast and works offline.
        </p>
        <p className="about-p">
          Each question shows its College Board ID. Copy it, or tap YouTube to
          look for a walkthrough of that exact question.
